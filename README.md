# Road_Lane_Detection

Road lane detection is extremely important for autonomous cars and self-driving vehicles. Once the road lanes are detected the vehicle can then manage to know where to go and prevent itself from getting into accidents. 

There are multiple ways to do road lane detection. One approach involves using deep learning on an labelled dataset. Another involves using pre-trained weights. However in this project I used another approach.

Using OpenCV the input video is altered so as to create a new video where the closest marks in the left lane and the right lane are highlighted in red. I have added comments to the oode so as to better explain what I am doing there.
